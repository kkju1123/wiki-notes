Enable natural citations for RAG applications by providing search results with source attribution

Search result content blocks let Claude cite your own content the same way it cites web search results: each citation carries the source and title you provided. Use them in RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications where Claude needs to attribute answers to your documents.

All [active models](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/models/overview) support search results with citations, with the exception of Claude Haiku 3. No beta header is required: search results are part of the standard Messages API.

## How it works

Search results can be provided in two ways:

1.   **From tool calls:** Your custom tools return search results, enabling dynamic RAG applications
2.   **As top-level content:** You provide search results directly in user messages for pre-fetched or cached content

In both cases, Claude cites the search results automatically when citations are enabled. No special prompting is needed: ask your question, and citations appear on the text blocks that draw on your content.

### Search result schema

Search results use the following structure:

### Required fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | string | Must be `"search_result"` |
| `source` | string | The source of the content. Any stable string works: a URL, or an internal identifier such as `kb://article-1234` |
| `title` | string | A descriptive title for the search result |
| `content` | array | An array of text blocks containing the actual content |

### Optional fields

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `citations` | object | Citation configuration with `enabled` Boolean field. Citations are disabled by default; every example on this page sets `"enabled": true` explicitly. All search results in a request must use the same setting (see [Citation control](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/search-results#citation-control)) |
| `cache_control` | object | Cache control settings (for example, `{"type": "ephemeral"}`) |

Each item in the `content` array must be a text block with:

*   `type`: Must be `"text"`
*   `text`: The actual text content (non-empty string)

Search results hold text only. Images and other media are not supported inside the `content` array.

## Method 1: Search results from tool calls

Returning search results from your custom tools enables dynamic RAG applications: tools fetch content at runtime, and Claude cites it in the response. The following example forces the tool call with [`tool_choice`](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/define-tools#forcing-tool-use), so the retrieval step runs every time.

### Example: Knowledge base tool

## Method 2: Search results as top-level content

You can also provide search results directly in user messages. This is useful for:

*   Pre-fetched content from your search infrastructure
*   Cached search results from previous queries
*   Content from external search services
*   Testing and development

### Example: Direct search results

## Claude's response with citations

Regardless of how search results are provided, Claude automatically includes citations when using information from them:

### Citation fields

Each citation includes:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type` | string | Always `"search_result_location"` for search result citations |
| `source` | string | The source from the original search result |
| `title` | string or null | The title from the original search result |
| `cited_text` | string | The full text of the cited block(s), concatenated. Equals the contents of `content[start_block_index:end_block_index]` joined together. Not counted toward output tokens. |
| `search_result_index` | integer | 0-based index of the cited search result among all `search_result` blocks in the request, in the order they appear (across all messages and tool results). |
| `start_block_index` | integer | 0-based index of the first cited block in the search result's `content` array. |
| `end_block_index` | integer | Exclusive end index of the cited block range in the search result's `content` array. Always greater than `start_block_index`. |

The block indices identify a slice of the search result's `content` array, and `cited_text` is the full text of that slice. The text block is the minimal citable unit: Claude cites whole blocks, not substrings within a block. To get finer-grained citations, split your search result content into smaller blocks (see [Multiple content blocks](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/search-results#multiple-content-blocks)).

## Multiple content blocks

Search results can contain multiple text blocks in the `content` array:

A citation referencing the rate limits block looks like:

When this search result is cited, `start_block_index` and `end_block_index` identify which of these blocks the citation covers, and `cited_text` contains exactly those blocks' text. Splitting content into smaller, focused blocks gives Claude finer citation boundaries; combining content into one block means every citation returns the full text. This is the same model used by [custom content documents](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/citations#custom-content-documents) in the Citations feature.

## Advanced usage

### Combining both methods

You can mix both methods in the same conversation. Claude cites from either source, and `search_result_index` counts all `search_result` blocks in request order, regardless of source.

The following example replays a complete conversation. The first user message carries a pre-fetched search result, the assistant turn calls a knowledge base tool, and the tool result returns a second search result. Claude's answer cites both sources:

The response cites both sources. The pre-fetched result is `search_result_index: 0` and the tool-returned result is `search_result_index: 1`, matching the order the `search_result` blocks appear in the conversation:

### Mixing with other content types

In user messages, `search_result` blocks can sit alongside any other content block. The Method 2 example pairs search results with a `text` question, and image or document blocks can join them the same way.

Tool results are stricter: if any block in a `tool_result` content array is a `search_result`, all of its blocks must be `search_result`. Mixing search results with other block types in the same tool result returns a validation error. To return supporting text alongside tool-sourced search results, include it as a text block inside one of the search results' `content` arrays, where it also becomes citable.

### Cache control

Add `cache_control` on the search result block to cache it for reuse across requests. It sits alongside `citations` on the same block:

See [Prompt caching](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) for minimum cacheable lengths and other requirements.

### Citation control

By default, citations are disabled for search results. You can enable citations by explicitly setting the `citations` configuration:

When `citations.enabled` is set to `true`, Claude attaches citation references to the text blocks that draw on the search result.

## Best practices

### For tool-based search (Method 1)

*   **Dynamic content:** Use for real-time searches and dynamic RAG applications
*   **Error handling:** Return appropriate messages when searches fail
*   **Result limits:** Return only the most relevant results to avoid context overflow

### For top-level search (Method 2)

*   **Pre-fetched content:** Use when you already have search results
*   **Batch processing:** Ideal for processing multiple search results at once
*   **Testing:** Great for testing citation behavior with known content

### General best practices

1.   **Structure results effectively:**

    *   Use clear, permanent source URLs
    *   Provide descriptive titles
    *   Break long content into logical text blocks to give Claude finer citation boundaries

2.   **Maintain consistency:**

    *   Use consistent source formats across your application
    *   Ensure titles accurately reflect content
    *   Keep formatting consistent

3.   **Handle errors gracefully:** when a search fails or returns nothing, return a plain text block describing the outcome (for example, `{"type": "text", "text": "No results found."}`) instead of raising an error: Claude explains the empty result to the user, and the conversation continues.

## Limitations

*   Search result content blocks are available on Claude API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud.
*   Only text content is supported within search results (no images or other media).
*   `search_result` blocks can only appear in user messages (including inside tool results). Assistant messages with search results are rejected.
*   When the [web search tool](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/web-search-tool) is enabled in the same request, citations must be enabled on all `search_result` blocks.

## Next steps

Detect and handle refusal stop reasons in streaming responses, and retry refused requests on a fallback model.

Ground Claude's responses in your source documents. Citations return the exact passages that support each claim, so you can verify answers and surface sources to your users.

Give Claude access to current web content with cited sources, optional dynamic filtering, and domain controls.
