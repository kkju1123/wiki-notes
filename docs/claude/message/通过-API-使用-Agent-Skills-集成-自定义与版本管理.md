## Overview

Skills integrate with the Messages API through the [code execution tool](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool). Whether using pre-built Skills managed by Anthropic or custom Skills you've uploaded, the integration shape is identical: both require code execution and use the same `container` structure.

### Using Skills

Skills integrate identically in the Messages API regardless of source. You specify Skills in the `container` parameter with a `skill_id`, `type`, and optional `version`, and they run in the code execution environment.

You can use Skills from two sources:

| Aspect | Anthropic Skills | Custom Skills |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Type value** | `anthropic` | `custom` |
| **Skill IDs** | Short names: `pptx`, `xlsx`, `docx`, `pdf` | Generated: `skill_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv` |
| **Version format** | Date-based: `20251013` or `latest` | Version ID: `skver_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv` or `latest` |
| **Management** | Pre-built and maintained by Anthropic | Upload and manage through the [Skills API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/skills/create) |
| **Availability** | Available to all users | Private to your workspace |

Both skill sources are returned by the [List Skills endpoint](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/skills/list) (use the `source` parameter to filter). The integration shape and execution environment are identical. The only difference is where the Skills come from and how they're managed.

### Prerequisites

To use Skills, you need:

1.   **Claude API key** from the [Claude Console](https://platform.claude.com/settings/keys)
2.   **[Code execution tool](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool)** enabled in your requests

Skills require the code execution tool, so use a model from its [model compatibility list](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool#compatibility).

* * *

## Using Skills in Messages

### Container parameter

Skills are specified using the `container` parameter in the Messages API. You can include up to 20 Skills for each request.

The structure is identical for both Anthropic and custom Skills. Specify the required `type` and `skill_id`, and optionally include `version` to pin to a specific version:

### Downloading generated files

When Skills create documents (Excel, PowerPoint, PDF, Word), they return `file_id` attributes in the response. You must use the Files API to download these files.

**How it works:**

1.   Skills create files during code execution.
2.   The response includes a `file_id` for each created file, inside code-execution tool result blocks (see [Response format](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool#response-format)).
3.   Use the Files API to download the actual file content.
4.   Save locally or process as needed.

To provide input files for Skills to work on, [upload them with the Files API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/files#uploading-a-file) and reference them in your request with a [container upload block](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/files#container-upload-blocks).

**Example: creating and downloading an Excel file**

**Additional Files API operations:**

### Multi-turn conversations

The response's `container` object carries the container's `id` and `expires_at` timestamp (see [Container reuse](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool#container-reuse) for lifetime details). Reuse the same container across multiple messages by specifying the container ID:

### Long-running operations

Skills may perform operations that require multiple turns. Handle `pause_turn` stop reasons:

### Using multiple Skills

Combine multiple Skills in a single request to handle complex workflows:

## Managing custom Skills

### Creating a Skill

A Skill bundle is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file at the top level with `name` and `description` YAML frontmatter, plus any supporting scripts or resources. See [Get started with Agent Skills in the API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/quickstart) to author one, and the **Requirements** list following the examples for the full constraints.

Upload your custom Skill to make it available in your workspace. You can upload a zip archive or individual file objects. The Python SDK also provides a `files_from_dir` helper that accepts a directory path.

Files are identified by the filename you attach (the `;filename=` suffix in the cURL example and the filename arguments in the SDK examples). For the walkthrough's skill, create a zip with `zip -r financial_skill.zip financial_skill/` and substitute it for the `example_skill.zip` placeholder in the zip-upload options.

**Requirements:**

*   Must include a `SKILL.md` file at the upload root (or at the top of a single enclosing folder)
*   `display_name` is optional: when omitted, it derives from the `SKILL.md``name`; an explicit value may be up to 255 characters and does not need to be unique within the workspace
*   Total upload size must be under 30 MB (uncompressed)
*   YAML frontmatter requirements:
    *   `name`: Maximum 64 characters, lowercase letters/numbers/hyphens only, no XML tags, no reserved words ("anthropic", "claude")
    *   `description`: Maximum 1024 characters, non-empty, no XML tags

For complete request/response schemas, see the [Create Skill API reference](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/skills/create).

### Listing Skills

Retrieve all Skills available to your workspace, including both Anthropic pre-built Skills and your custom Skills. Use the `source` parameter to filter by skill type:

See the [List Skills API reference](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/skills/list) for pagination and filtering options.

### Retrieving a Skill

Get details about a specific Skill:

### Deleting a Skill

Deleting a Skill also removes all of its versions.

### Versioning

Skills support versioning to manage updates safely:

**Anthropic Skills:**

*   Versions use date format: `20251013`
*   New versions released as updates are made
*   Specify exact versions for stability

**Custom Skills:**

*   Auto-generated version IDs: `skver_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv`
*   Use `"latest"` to always get the most recent version
*   Create new versions when updating Skill files

A new version is a complete snapshot, not a delta: upload the Skill's full file set each time. Files you omit are not carried over, and the `name` in the new version's `SKILL.md` must match the Skill's existing name. The following examples re-upload the complete `financial_skill/` bundle from [Creating a Skill](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/skills-guide#creating-a-skill).

See the [Create Skill Version API reference](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/skills/versions/create) for complete details.

## How Skills are loaded

When you specify Skills in a container:

1.   **Metadata discovery:** Claude sees metadata for each Skill (name, description) in the system prompt.
2.   **File loading:** Skill files are copied into the container at `/skills/{skill-name}/`. The directory is the Skill's name (`pptx` for an Anthropic Skill, the `SKILL.md``name` for a custom Skill), not its `skill_01...` ID.
3.   **Automatic use:** Claude automatically loads and uses Skills when relevant to your request.
4.   **Composition:** Multiple Skills compose together for complex workflows.

Claude loads full Skill instructions only when needed.

* * *

## Use cases

Skills fit both organizational and personal work. Organizations use them to apply brand formatting to documents, structure notes and reports around company templates, and run company-specific analytical procedures. Individuals use them for custom document templates, specialized data pipelines, and code generation or deployment conventions.

### Example: financial modeling

Combine Excel and custom DCF analysis Skills:

## Limits and constraints

### Request limits

*   **Maximum Skills per request:** 20
*   **Maximum Skill upload size:** 30 MB (all files combined, uncompressed)
*   **YAML frontmatter requirements:**
    *   `name`: Maximum 64 characters, lowercase letters/numbers/hyphens only, no XML tags, no reserved words ("anthropic", "claude")
    *   `description`: Maximum 1024 characters, non-empty, no XML tags

### Environment constraints

Skills run in the code execution container with these limitations:

*   **No network access:** Cannot make external API calls
*   **No runtime package installation:** Only pre-installed packages available
*   **Isolated environment:** A fresh container is created unless you specify an existing container ID

See [Code execution tool](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool) for available packages.

* * *

## Best practices

### When to use multiple Skills

Combine Skills when tasks involve multiple document types or domains:

**Good use cases:**

*   Data analysis (Excel) + presentation creation (PowerPoint)
*   Report generation (Word) + export to PDF
*   Custom domain logic + document generation

**Avoid:**

*   Including unused Skills (impacts performance)

### Version management strategy

The SDK tabs in this section show the `container` value to include in a Messages request. The cURL and CLI tabs show the full request.

**For production:** pin a specific version, so Skill updates never change your deployed behavior. If you omit `version` or set it to `"latest"`, requests use the newest version of the Skill, so a version uploaded by anyone in the [workspace](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/skills-guide#workspace-scoped-access) immediately changes what your production agents run. The version ID comes from the create-version response in [Versioning](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/skills-guide#versioning) or from the [List Skill Versions API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/skills/versions/list). The ID is always a string, so quote it in JSON or YAML even when it looks numeric.

**For development:** use `latest` to pick up the newest version automatically as you iterate.

### Prompt caching considerations

If you use [Prompt caching](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-caching), changing the Skills list in your container breaks the cache. Skills render into the system prompt in a fixed order, so the same list produces the same cacheable prefix:

For best caching performance, keep your Skills list, including its order, consistent across requests. Pinning custom Skill versions also helps: with `"latest"`, publishing a new version can invalidate the cached prefix if it changes the Skill's description.

### Error handling

Handle Skill-related errors gracefully:

## Migrate from `skills-2025-10-02`

The Skills API is out of beta and needs no beta header. Migrating off `skills-2025-10-02` is optional: requests that still send it keep working and keep returning the beta response shapes, so an existing integration keeps working until you change it. Removing the header switches those requests to the shapes documented on this page:

|  | With `skills-2025-10-02` | Without the header |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Skill label | `display_title` (up to 64 characters, unique per workspace) | `display_name` (up to 255 characters, not unique); derived from the `SKILL.md``name` when omitted |
| Newest version pointer | `latest_version`, an epoch-microsecond string such as `"1759178010641129"` | `latest_version_id`, a version ID such as `"skver_01AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUv"`; `GET /v1/skills/{skill_id}/versions/latest` resolves it in one call |
| Version identifier in URLs | Epoch-microsecond string | Version ID (`skver_...`). IDs captured under the beta with the `skill_version_` prefix are accepted as input. |
| Version object | Includes `directory` (always equal to the Skill `name`) | No `directory` field |
| `source` | A string, `"custom"` or `"anthropic"` | An object, for example `{"type": "custom"}`; the example catalog value is `"anthropic_example"` |
| List responses | `{ data, has_more, next_page }` | `{ data, next_page }`; `limit` from 1 to 1,000 (default 20) |
| Versions list order | Oldest first | Newest first, default `limit` 20. Page cursors from one shape are not valid on the other. |
| Deleting a Skill | Returns a 400 error while any version exists | Deletes the Skill and all of its versions |
| Deleting a Skill's only version | Allowed, leaving a Skill with no versions | Returns a 400 error; upload a replacement version first, or delete the Skill |
| Upload layout | Files must sit inside a top-level directory whose name matches the Skill `name` | `SKILL.md` may sit at the root of the upload; stored paths are the same either way |
| Response types | `CreateSkillResponse`, `GetSkillResponse`, and one type per operation | `Skill`, `SkillVersion`, `DeletedSkill`, `DeletedSkillVersion` |

To migrate:

1.   **Remove the beta header.** Drop `anthropic-beta: skills-2025-10-02` from your requests. In the SDKs, call `client.skills` instead of `client.beta.skills`; keeping `client.beta.skills` works only on the [SDK releases that no longer send the header](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/skills-guide#sdk-beta-namespace). Earlier releases send it from `client.beta.skills` even with no `betas` argument.
2.   **Rename fields** in your code: `display_title` to `display_name`, `latest_version` to `latest_version_id`, and read `source.type` instead of comparing `source` to a string.
3.   **Use version IDs.** Wherever you stored an epoch-microsecond version, store the version's `id` instead, or use `latest`. Skill references in Messages requests accept a version ID, `latest`, or (for Anthropic Skills) the catalog version.
4.   **Review delete calls.**`DELETE /v1/skills/{skill_id}` now removes every version with the Skill. If you relied on the beta's refusal as a safeguard, add your own check.

A Skill whose versions were all deleted under the beta has no current version to return: `GET /v1/skills/{skill_id}` returns a 400 error and the Skill is omitted from list responses until you upload a version to it. You can still delete it.

### SDK beta namespace

Starting with Python SDK 1.2.0, TypeScript SDK 0.122.0, Go SDK 1.68.0, Java SDK 2.59.0, Ruby SDK 1.67.0, and C# SDK 12.44.0, `client.beta.skills` no longer sends `skills-2025-10-02` and returns the same shapes as `client.skills`, with `Beta`-prefixed type names (`BetaSkill`, `BetaSkillVersion`, `BetaDeletedSkill`, `BetaDeletedSkillVersion`). It accepts a `betas` argument for Skills features that are still in beta. In the beta Messages types, the container Skill reference type is renamed from `BetaSkill` to `BetaContainerSkill` (same fields: `type`, `skill_id`, `version`); `BetaSkill` now names the Skill resource, matching `Skill` and `ContainerSkill` in the non-beta types. Earlier SDK releases are typed to the beta shapes; if you depend on those types, stay on an earlier release until you migrate.

## Data retention

Agent Skills are not covered by ZDR arrangements. Skill definitions and execution data are retained according to Anthropic's standard data retention policy.

For ZDR eligibility across all features, see [API and data retention](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/api-and-data-retention).

## Audit logging

If your organization has the [Compliance API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/compliance-api) enabled, its [Activity Feed](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/compliance-activity-feed) records the creation and deletion of Skills and Skill versions made with a Claude API key or from the Claude Console. Operations that occur while the Compliance API is off are not recorded and cannot be recovered later, so [set up the Compliance API](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/compliance-api-access) before you rely on this audit trail.
