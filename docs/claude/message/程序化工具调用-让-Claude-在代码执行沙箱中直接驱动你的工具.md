Let Claude call your tools from code in the code execution container, cutting model round trips and token use in multi-tool workflows.

Programmatic tool calling allows Claude to write code that calls your tools programmatically within a [code execution](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool) container, rather than requiring round trips through the model for each tool invocation. This reduces latency for multi-tool workflows and decreases token consumption by allowing Claude to filter or process data before it reaches the model's context window. On agentic search benchmarks like [BrowseComp](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12516) and [DeepSearchQA](https://github.com/google-deepmind/deepsearchqa), which test multistep web research and complex information retrieval, adding programmatic tool calling on top of basic search tools improved performance by an average of 11% while using 24% fewer input tokens (see [Improved web search with dynamic filtering](https://claude.com/blog/improved-web-search-with-dynamic-filtering)).

Consider checking budget compliance across 20 employees: the traditional approach requires 20 separate model round-trips, pulling thousands of expense line items into the context along the way. With programmatic tool calling, a single script runs all 20 lookups, filters the results, and returns only the employees who exceeded their limits, shrinking what Claude needs to reason over from hundreds of kilobytes down to a handful of lines.

Programmatic tool calling requires the [code execution tool](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool) with tool version `code_execution_20260120` or later.

## Quick start

Here's an example where Claude programmatically queries a database multiple times and aggregates results. Adding `allowed_callers: ["code_execution_20260120"]` to a tool definition is what makes that tool callable from within code execution (see [The `allowed_callers` field](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/programmatic-tool-calling#the-allowed-callers-field)):

The response stops with `stop_reason: "tool_use"`, a `container` ID, and a `tool_use` block for `query_database` whose `caller` field identifies the code execution run that called it. Return the result as shown in [Step 3 of the example workflow](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/programmatic-tool-calling#step-3-provide-tool-result) so the code can finish.

## How programmatic tool calling works

When you configure a tool to be callable from code execution and Claude determines that tool is needed:

1.   Claude writes Python code that invokes the tool as a function, potentially including multiple tool calls and pre/post-processing logic
2.   Claude runs this code in a sandboxed container through code execution
3.   When a tool function is called, code execution pauses and the API returns a `tool_use` block
4.   You provide the tool result, and code execution continues (intermediate results are not loaded into Claude's context window)
5.   Once all code execution completes, Claude receives the final output and continues working on the task

This approach is particularly useful for:

*   **Large data processing:** Filter or aggregate tool results before they reach Claude's context
*   **Multistep workflows:** Save tokens and latency by calling tools serially or in a loop without sampling Claude in-between tool calls
*   **Conditional logic:** Make decisions based on intermediate tool results

## Core concepts

### The `allowed_callers` field

The `allowed_callers` field specifies which contexts can invoke a tool:

**Possible values:**

*   `["direct"]` - Claude is guided to call this tool directly (default if omitted)
*   `["code_execution_20260120"]` - Claude is guided to call this tool only from within code execution
*   `["direct", "code_execution_20260120"]` - Claude may call this tool directly or from within code execution

Both `"code_execution_20260120"` and `"code_execution_20260521"` are accepted in `allowed_callers` and are interchangeable: a request using either code-execution tool version satisfies tools that list either caller. Response blocks always tag the caller as `code_execution_20260120` regardless of which version the request declared.

### The `caller` field in responses

Every tool use block includes a `caller` field indicating how it was invoked:

**Direct invocation (traditional tool use):**

**Programmatic invocation:**

The `tool_id` is the `id` of the code execution `server_tool_use` block that made the call, so you can match each programmatic `tool_use` to the code execution run that produced it.

### Container lifecycle

Programmatic tool calling uses the same containers as code execution:

*   **Container creation:** A new container is created for each request unless you reuse an existing one
*   **Container ID:** Returned in responses in the `container` field, along with an `expires_at` timestamp
*   **Reuse:** Pass the container ID back on the next request to keep state. While a programmatic tool call is waiting for your result, the container ID is required on that request, not optional: the API rejects the request without it.
*   **Expiration:**`expires_at` tells you how long the container has left. Idle containers are currently reclaimed after about 5 minutes, and no container can be reused more than 30 days after it was created.

## Example workflow

Here's how a complete programmatic tool calling flow works:

### Step 1: Initial request

Send a request with code execution and a tool that allows programmatic calling. To enable programmatic calling, add the `allowed_callers` field to your tool definition.

The request shape is identical to the [Quick start](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/programmatic-tool-calling#quick-start) example: include `code_execution` in your tools list, add `allowed_callers: ["code_execution_20260120"]` to any tool you want Claude to invoke from code, and send your user message. The remaining steps in this workflow use the user message `"Query customer purchase history from the last quarter and identify our top 5 customers by revenue"`.

### Step 2: API response with tool call

Claude writes code that calls your tool. The API pauses and returns:

### Step 3: Provide tool result

Send the full conversation history plus your tool result. Three details matter on this request:

*   The user message that carries your result can contain only `tool_result` blocks. See [Message formatting restrictions](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/programmatic-tool-calling#message-formatting-restrictions).
*   Pass the `container` ID from the paused response. The API rejects a continuation that has pending programmatic tool calls but no container ID.
*   Send the same `tools` array as the original request. The code execution tool must still be present for the paused code to resume, and the tools you send on this request are the definitions Claude and the running code can use for the rest of the turn.

### Step 4: Next tool call or completion

The code picks up where it paused and processes your result. Each continuation response either pauses again with more programmatic `tool_use` blocks, or completes the code execution and lets Claude continue the turn (Step 5). Check `stop_reason` and each `tool_use` block's `caller` to tell the two apart: a response that pauses for you has `stop_reason: "tool_use"` and a `tool_use` block whose `caller` names a code execution version, and you repeat Step 3 with a `tool_result` for every pending programmatic call in one user message.

### Step 5: Final response

Once the code execution completes, Claude provides the final response:

## Advanced patterns

### Batch processing with loops

Claude can write code that processes multiple items efficiently:

This pattern:

*   Reduces model round-trips from N (one per region) to 1
*   Processes large result sets programmatically before returning to Claude
*   Saves tokens by only returning aggregated conclusions instead of raw data

### Early termination

Claude can stop processing as soon as success criteria are met:

### Conditional tool selection

### Data filtering

## Response format

### Programmatic tool call

When code execution calls a tool:

### Tool result handling

Your tool result is passed back to the running code:

### Code execution completion

When all tool calls are satisfied and code completes:

## Error handling

### Common errors

| Error | Where it appears | Description | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `invalid_tool_input` | `error_code` on the `code_execution_tool_result` error block in the response | Invalid parameters were passed to the code execution tool | See the [code execution tool errors](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool#errors) |
| `invalid_request_error` (on `tool_choice`) | HTTP 400 error response | `tool_choice` names a tool whose `allowed_callers` does not include `"direct"` | Either add `"direct"` to that tool's `allowed_callers`, or remove the tool from `tool_choice` and let Claude invoke it from code |

### Container expiration during tool call

If your tool result doesn't arrive within about 4 minutes, the pending call raises a `TimeoutError` inside Claude's running code. Claude sees the error in `stderr` and typically retries the call:

To prevent timeouts:

*   Monitor the `expires_at` field in responses
*   Implement timeouts for your tool execution
*   Consider breaking long operations into smaller chunks

### Tool execution errors

If your tool returns an error:

Claude's code receives this error and can handle it appropriately.

## Constraints and limitations

### Feature incompatibilities

*   **Structured outputs:** Tools with `strict: true` are not supported with programmatic calling
*   **Tool choice:** You cannot force programmatic calling of a specific tool through `tool_choice`
*   **Parallel tool use:**`disable_parallel_tool_use: true` is not supported with programmatic calling

### Input schema limitations

Custom tools whose `input_schema` contains a recursive `$ref` (a reference cycle, such as a schema that refers to itself) cannot be enabled for programmatic calling. Including a code execution tool version in `allowed_callers` for such a tool causes the request to fail with a `400 invalid_request_error` whose message contains `Circular $ref detected`. The same schema is accepted for direct tool calling.

To work around this, do one of the following:

*   Keep the tool direct-only by omitting `allowed_callers` (or setting it to `["direct"]`). Other tools in the same request can still use programmatic calling.
*   Remove the cycle from the schema. For example, unroll the recursion to a fixed depth and describe any deeper nesting in the `description` of the innermost level, or replace the recursive property with a plain `{"type": "object"}` whose `description` explains the expected shape.

### Tool restrictions

The following tools cannot be called programmatically:

*   Tools provided by an [MCP connector](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/mcp-connector)
*   The [computer use](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/computer-use-tool) and [browser use](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/browser-use-tool) toolsets (`computer_toolset_20260801` and `browser_toolset_20260801`), whose `allowed_callers` field accepts only `"direct"`

### Message formatting restrictions

When responding to programmatic tool calls, there are strict formatting requirements:

**Tool result only responses:** If there are pending programmatic tool calls waiting for results, your response message must contain **only**`tool_result` blocks. You cannot include any text content, even after the tool results.

Invalid - Cannot include text when responding to programmatic tool calls:

Valid - Only tool results when responding to programmatic tool calls:

This restriction only applies when responding to programmatic (code execution) tool calls. For regular client-side tool calls, you can include text content after tool results.

**Text-only tool result content:** The `content` of each `tool_result` that answers a programmatic call must be a string or `text` blocks. Image, document, and other content block types are rejected.

### Rate limits

Programmatic tool calls are subject to the same rate limits as regular tool calls. Each tool call from code execution counts as a separate invocation.

### Validate tool results before use

When implementing user-defined tools that will be called programmatically:

*   **Tool results are returned as strings:** They can contain any content, including code snippets or executable commands that may be processed by the execution environment.
*   **Validate external tool results:** If your tool returns data from external sources or accepts user input, be aware of code injection risks if the output will be interpreted or executed as code.

## Token efficiency

Programmatic tool calling reduces token consumption in three ways:

*   **Tool results from programmatic calls are not added to Claude's context** - only the final code output is
*   **Intermediate processing happens in code** - filtering, aggregation, and other transformations don't consume model tokens
*   **Multiple tool calls in one code execution** - reduces overhead compared to separate model turns

For example, calling 10 tools directly uses ~10x the tokens of calling them programmatically and returning a summary.

In Anthropic's internal evaluations on a production Claude model:

*   On a 75-tool project-management agent benchmark, enabling programmatic tool calling reduced billed input tokens by roughly 38% with no change in task accuracy.
*   On [τ²-bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07982) (airline, retail, and telecom domains), where each turn makes one or two sequential tool calls, programmatic tool calling left scores unchanged and cost roughly 8% more. Sequential single-call workflows do not benefit.
*   Across production API traffic, requests whose `tools` array contains 10 to 49 tool definitions see typical token savings of 20% to 40% with programmatic tool calling enabled.

Actual savings vary with workload shape. See [When to use programmatic calling](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/programmatic-tool-calling#when-to-use-programmatic-calling).

## Usage and pricing

Programmatic tool calling uses the same pricing as code execution. See the [code execution pricing](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool#usage-and-pricing) for details.

## Best practices

### Tool design

*   **Provide detailed output descriptions:** Because Claude deserializes tool results in code, document the format (JSON structure and field types)
*   **Return structured data:** JSON or other machine-readable formats work best for programmatic processing
*   **Keep responses concise:** Return only necessary data to minimize processing overhead

### When to use programmatic calling

Programmatic tool calling trades a small fixed overhead (container startup, script generation) for large savings on tool-result tokens and model round-trips. Whether that trade pays off depends on workload shape.

**Strong fit:**

*   Fan-out or parallel operations across many items (for example, checking 50 endpoints or looking up 20 records)
*   Large tool results that can be filtered, aggregated, or summarized before reaching Claude's context
*   Agentic search and retrieval, where iterative querying and result filtering dominate the workflow

**Weak fit:**

*   Strictly sequential workflows where each call depends on Claude reasoning over the previous result, because the script cannot skip the model round-trip in that case
*   A small number of tool calls with small responses, especially on the first turn of a conversation, where container and script overhead can exceed the savings
*   Tools that require immediate user feedback between calls

If you are unsure, measure billed input tokens with and without `allowed_callers` on a representative sample of your traffic before enabling it broadly.

### Performance optimization

*   **Reuse containers** when making multiple related requests to maintain state
*   **Batch similar operations** in a single code execution when possible

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues

**`invalid_request_error` when setting `tool_choice`**

*   `tool_choice` cannot name a tool whose `allowed_callers` omits `"direct"`. Either add `"direct"` to that tool's `allowed_callers`, or remove the tool from `tool_choice` and let Claude invoke it from code.

**Container expiration**

*   Respond to each programmatic tool call well before the paused response's `expires_at` timestamp. Claude's code stops waiting for a result after about 4 minutes, and idle containers are currently reclaimed after about 5 minutes.
*   Consider implementing faster tool execution

**Tool result not parsed correctly**

*   Ensure your tool returns string data that Claude can deserialize
*   Provide clear output format documentation in your tool description

### Debugging tips

1.   **Log all tool calls and results** to track the flow
2.   **Check the `caller` field** to confirm programmatic invocation
3.   **Monitor container IDs** to ensure proper reuse
4.   **Test tools independently** before enabling programmatic calling

## Why programmatic tool calling works

Claude is trained on large amounts of code, so presenting tools as callable Python functions lets it use that strength:

*   **Tool composition:** Chained calls, loops, and conditionals are ordinary Python control flow instead of a series of model round trips
*   **Result processing:** Claude's code filters and aggregates large tool outputs, or writes them to files, and only the final output enters the context window
*   **Latency:** The model is not re-sampled between the tool calls inside one code execution

## Alternative implementations

Programmatic tool calling is a generalizable pattern that can also be implemented on your own infrastructure. Here's how the approaches compare:

### Client-side direct execution

Provide Claude with a code execution tool and describe what functions are available in that environment. When Claude invokes the tool with code, your application executes it locally where those functions are defined.

**Advantages:**

*   Minimal re-architecting of your application
*   Full control over the environment and instructions

**Disadvantages:**

*   Executes untrusted code outside of a sandbox
*   Tool invocations can be vectors for code injection

**Use when:** Your application can safely execute arbitrary code, you want the smallest implementation, and Anthropic's managed offering doesn't fit your needs.

### Self-managed sandboxed execution

Same approach from Claude's perspective, but code runs in a sandboxed container with security restrictions (for example, no network egress). If your tools require external resources, you'll need a protocol for executing tool calls outside the sandbox.

**Advantages:**

*   Safe programmatic tool calling on your own infrastructure
*   Full control over the execution environment

**Disadvantages:**

*   Complex to build and maintain
*   Requires managing both infrastructure and inter-process communication

**Use when:** Security is critical and Anthropic's managed solution doesn't fit your requirements.

### Anthropic-managed execution

Anthropic's programmatic tool calling is a managed version of sandboxed execution with an opinionated Python environment tuned for Claude. Anthropic handles container management, code execution, and secure tool invocation communication.

**Advantages:**

*   Safe and secure by default
*   Enabled with a tool definition, with no infrastructure to run
*   Environment and instructions optimized for Claude

Consider using Anthropic's managed solution if you're using the Claude API, [Claude Platform on AWS](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-platform-on-aws), or [Microsoft Foundry](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-in-microsoft-foundry). On Microsoft Foundry, programmatic tool calling requires a [Hosted on Anthropic deployment](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/claude-in-microsoft-foundry#additional-features-not-supported-when-hosted-on-azure).

## Data retention

Programmatic tool calling is built on the code execution infrastructure and uses the same sandbox containers. Container data, including execution artifacts and outputs, is retained for up to 30 days.

For ZDR eligibility across all features, see [API and data retention](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/api-and-data-retention).

## Next steps

Stream tool inputs without server-side JSON buffering for latency-sensitive applications.

Run Python and bash code in a sandboxed container to analyze data, generate files, and iterate on solutions.

Connect Claude to external tools and APIs. See where tools execute, when Claude calls them, and which tool fits your task.

Specify tool schemas, write effective descriptions, and control when Claude calls your tools.
