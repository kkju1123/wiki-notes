# Build an orchestration mode

Copy page



Build a session-level mode that grants standing consent for multiagent fan-out, switched on and off with mid-conversation system messages.

Copy page



An orchestration mode is a session-level switch: when it is on, the model puts maximum thoroughness behind every substantive request, scouting the task itself and then fanning work out to parallel subagents by default. When it is off, the same orchestration tool goes back to per-request opt-in.

The mode is not an API parameter. It is built entirely from documented pieces:

1.   **An effort level:** requests run at a documented [Effort](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort) value such as `xhigh`. There is no hidden level above the ones on that page. This example sets effort at the top level of each request, which needs no beta header.
2.   **A mode reminder:** a [mid-conversation system message](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/mid-conversation-system-messages) tells the model the mode is active, with a one-line refresher every several turns and an exit notice when the mode is turned off. The top-level `system` field never changes, so the cached prefix stays intact.
3.   **Standing consent in the tool description:** the orchestration tool's description states that while the mode is on, the model should author and run a workflow for every substantive task without asking first.



This example uses mid-conversation system messages; for the models and platforms that support them, see [Mid-conversation system messages](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/mid-conversation-system-messages). The fan-out itself multiplies token usage: a single request can spawn many subagent conversations, so reserve the mode for work that justifies the cost.

## Set up the loop

The example is a single file. The constants control the effort level, the fan-out shape, and how often the mode refresher is re-sent. `MAX_CONCURRENT` caps how many subagents run at the same time (the PHP port is sequential and ignores it); `MAX_TOTAL_SUBTASKS` caps how many the model may queue in a single Workflow call. Splitting the two lets the model plan a large backlog without launching it all at once. The `DOC_TEST_MODE` check caps the loops to a single turn when that environment variable is set, so the automated docs harness can validate that the file compiles and finishes quickly without running the full orchestration; leave it unset when running the example yourself.

import atexit
import concurrent.futures

import os
import shutil

import sys

import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

MODEL = "claude-opus-5"
EFFORT = "xhigh"

SYSTEM_PROMPT = "You are a helpful general-purpose agent. Answer the user's request directly."

REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 600
BASH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 60
TOOL_RESULT_MAX_CHARS = 8000
MAX_CONCURRENT = 10
DOC_TEST_MODE = bool(os.environ.get("DOC_TEST_MODE"))
MAX_TOTAL_SUBTASKS = 2 if DOC_TEST_MODE else 200
MAX_SUBAGENT_TURNS = 1 if DOC_TEST_MODE else 15
MAX_MAIN_TURNS = 1 if DOC_TEST_MODE else 30
TURNS_BETWEEN_REFRESHERS = 10
JOURNAL_PATH = os.environ.get("ORCH_JOURNAL") or "orchestration_journal.json"
```

## Define the mode reminders

The reminders are short on purpose. They flip the mode and point at the tool description, where the heavyweight instructions live. The full text is sent once when the mode turns on, the refresher is re-sent only after several user turns, and the exit notice is sent once when the mode turns off.

Python TypeScript C#Go Java PHP Ruby



```
MODE_ENTER = (
    "Orchestration mode is on: optimize for the most exhaustive, correct answer rather than "
    "the fastest one. Use the Workflow tool on every substantive task, sized to the problem's "
    "natural decomposition rather than the maximum the tool allows. See the Workflow tool's "
    "description for standing consent, granularity guidance, and quality patterns. Work solo "
    "only on conversational or trivial turns."
)
MODE_REFRESH = (
    "Orchestration mode is still on. Use the Workflow tool; see its standing consent section."
)
MODE_EXIT = (
    "Orchestration mode is off. The Workflow tool's standard opt-in rule applies again."
)
```

## Grant standing consent in the tool description

The Workflow tool carries the real behavioral contract: the opt-in rule, the standing consent that applies while the mode is on, granularity guidance for sizing the fan-out, and the quality patterns the model can reach for (a verification wave, a completeness critic, multiphase sequencing). Subagents also get a `report_findings` tool so their results come back as structured JSON instead of prose, and the bash tool is the Anthropic-defined `bash_20250124` tool run locally.

        "system message confirms that orchestration mode is on.\n\n"
        "Quality patterns: adversarial verification (a second wave of agents checks the first "
        "wave's findings against the source), a completeness critic (one agent hunts for what "
        "the others missed), and multiphase sequencing (understand, design, implement, and "
        "review as separate workflow calls, reading results between phases). A useful default "
        "is hybrid: scout inline first to discover the work-list, then fan out over it.\n\n"

## Run the bash tool locally

The bash handler runs the requested command with a timeout, captures combined stdout and stderr, and truncates the result so a runaway command can't flood the context window. Commands run in the directory you launch the example from, so pointing it at a project means starting it there; when `DOC_TEST_MODE` is set, the harness instead gives bash a small throwaway fixture directory that is removed on exit. There is no sandbox here: the command runs with the permissions of the process that launched the example. For clarity this example runs each call in a fresh subshell rather than maintaining the persistent session the `bash_20250124` contract describes; a production agent should back the tool with a long-lived shell so that working directory, environment, and the `restart` action behave as documented.

```
# Run bash where the example was launched. In DOC_TEST_MODE the docs harness

if DOC_TEST_MODE:

    atexit.register(shutil.rmtree, WORK_DIR, ignore_errors=True)
    with open(os.path.join(WORK_DIR, "sample.py"), "w") as fixture:
        fixture.write(

## Run one subagent

Each workflow subtask becomes its own small agent loop with the bash tool, running at the same effort as the main loop. A per-request timeout bounds each API call so a dropped connection degrades one subagent instead of stalling the whole run.

        "You are one agent in a larger parallel fan-out, assigned a single subtask. "
        "Investigate it directly, using bash to check facts rather than guessing, and finish "
        "by calling report_findings exactly once. Return findings, not narration."
    )
    messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]

## Journal results so reruns resume

A fan-out that spawns dozens of subagents is expensive to restart from scratch. A small content-addressed journal makes it idempotent: before dispatching a subagent, look up the SHA-256 of its prompt in a local JSON file, and return the recorded result if one exists. Interrupt the run, rerun it, and only the subtasks that never finished are recomputed. The journal deduplicates across runs, not within a single fan-out wave; delete the journal file to start fresh.

Python TypeScript C#Go Java PHP Ruby



```
_journal_lock = threading.Lock()

def _load_journal() -> dict:
    try:
        with open(JOURNAL_PATH) as file:
            return json.load(file) or {}
    except (OSError, json.JSONDecodeError):
        return {}

def journaled(prompt: str, compute) -> str:
    """Return a cached result for this exact prompt, or compute and persist it. This
    makes the fan-out resumable: interrupt the run, rerun it, and only the subtasks
    that never finished are recomputed. Delete the journal file to start fresh."""

    cached = _load_journal().get(key)
    if cached is not None:

## Fan out, then verify

The fan-out accepts up to `MAX_TOTAL_SUBTASKS` prompts, runs them through the journal with at most `MAX_CONCURRENT` in flight (sequential in the PHP port), and isolates failures so one broken subagent degrades to an error string instead of ending the run. Once the first wave finishes, a second wave reuses the same subagent path to try to refute each result: every verifier re-derives the claims from the source, defaulting to refuted when uncertain. Both the original result and its verdict are returned to the orchestrator so it can weigh them together.

## Toggle the mode with mid-conversation system messages

The agent appends the user's message first, then any system messages that are due: the exit notice, the full mode text on entry, or the periodic refresher. Placing the system message after the user turn keeps every cached byte ahead of it untouched, and satisfies the placement rule that a system message follows a user turn.

## Run it



The bash tool in this example runs model-written commands directly on your machine with no sandbox, and the fan-out runs several of those agents in parallel. Run it in a directory and environment you are comfortable exposing, and add sandboxing before adapting it for anything beyond local experimentation.

Python TypeScript C#Go Java PHP Ruby



```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    task = (
        sys.argv[1]
        if len(sys.argv) > 1
        else "Explore the current directory, then give a thorough review: what it does, "
        "code-quality issues, and concrete improvements."
    )
    agent = ModeAgent(MODEL)
    print(agent.turn(task))
    agent.set_mode(False)
    print(agent.turn("Briefly summarize what you found above, no fan-out needed."))
```

Start the example from the directory you want the agents to work in, for example the root of a repository to review:

`python orchestration_mode.py "Review this repository for flaky tests and propose fixes."`



With the mode on, expect the model to scout with a few bash commands, dispatch the Workflow tool unprompted, and synthesize the subagent reports into a final answer. Trivial or conversational requests stay solo, as the reminder instructs.

## Toward a production harness

This example is deliberately small. A harness meant for real workloads would typically add:

*   **Sandboxed orchestration scripts:** let the model emit a short orchestration program (branching, loops, and reduce steps) and run it inside an isolated interpreter, rather than accepting only a flat list of subtask strings.
*   **Durable journaling:** replace the local JSON file with a store that survives process restarts and is safe under concurrent writers across machines.
*   **Budget enforcement:** track total subagents launched across the whole session, not just per Workflow call, and refuse to exceed a hard cap so a runaway plan cannot exhaust your quota.

The patterns in this example (the mode reminders, standing consent in the tool description, journaling, and a verification wave) carry over unchanged; only the execution substrate around them gets more robust.
